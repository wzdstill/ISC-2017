\section{Conclusion and Open Problems}
In this paper, we propose the first lattice-based inner product encryption whose size of public parameters and ciphertext does not linearly depend on the length of predicate/attribute vectors, at the expense of only constant growth of the modulus $q$ in terms of the security parameter $\secparam$. This leaves open two possibilities: (1) further optimize the system to achieve smaller ratio $|\ct, \pp| / t$ ($t$ is the length parameter), and (2) optimize the size of public parameters and ciphertexts of functional encryption for more general functions (instead of inner product), like ABE for polynomial-depth functions. Another important open problem about security, as discussed in Remark~\ref{rem:sec}, is to achieve attribute-hiding functional encryption from LWE, for simple functionality such as inner product or more general functionalities.
